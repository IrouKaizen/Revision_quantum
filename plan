Please note that the Qiskit installation must specify version 0.43 for the notebook code to work
!pip install qiskit[visualization]==0.43

Yesterday, version 1.0.0 of Qiskit was released and the code is not compatible with this new version.
If you simply install Qiskit, the latest version will be installed and you will not be able to run the notebooks.
